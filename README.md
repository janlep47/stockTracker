# stockTracker
Android application to see current data related to a list of favorite stocks.  
This is a Udacity Evaluated Assignment.

## Purpose
To display current stock price, and change in price since yesterday, for a list 
of tracked stocks.  The look and feel of this app was inspired by the Android 
Yahoo finance app.  This app has most of the same functionality except for two 
things: there are no links to related articles in the detail screen (for an 
individual stock), and beta is not calculated.  Otherwise, this app shows a list
 of stocks and a detail screen of the selected stock, in the same way that the 
Yahoo finance app does.  Also, you may add/delete stocks from your list of 
tracked stocks.  In addition, this app comes with a widget.

## Installation
Import this repository to AndroidStudio; you can then upload a debug version
 of this app to an Android device.  There should not be a release version of 
this app, as it is a look-and-feel copy of the (free) Android Yahoo finance 
app.

## Instructions
The code is written in java and xml.
